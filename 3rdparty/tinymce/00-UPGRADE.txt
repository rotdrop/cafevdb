We need a special tiny-MCE branch from here:

https://github.com/rotdrop/tinymce.git

Use one of the branches

feature/nonce-csp@VERSION

where VERSION is one of the available versions. If it is not there for
the desired upstream version, try to rebase the latest existing
feature branch to the desired upstream branch.

Then build tinymce, see CONTRIBUTING.md there. We need the
distribution zip-archive tinymce_VERSION.zip.

cd PROJECTROOT/3rdparty/tinymce
mkdir blah
cd blah
unzip tinymce_VERSION.zip

Copy the entire tree

cp -a tinymce/js/tinymce/. ../.

The changelog if desired:

cp tinymce/CHANGELOG.md ../

cd ..

Afterwards the orchestra app needs to be rebuilt
