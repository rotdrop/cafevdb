/**
 * Validates email address
 *
 * Email address format as defined in RFCs 822, 2822 and 5322 is quite complex
 * and has many uncommon features. This rule was designed with registration
 * forms in mind, where a user usually enters her email address
 * in order to receive a newsletter or a confirmation. So it currently
 * supports a most common subset of email address format, disallowing
 *  - domain literals like root@[127.0.0.1] or root@[IPv6:::]
 *  - quoted strings in local part "John Doe"@example.com
 *
 * Support for these may be added in the future, until then you may consider
 * using PHP filter_var() function with FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL. Note also that
 * the characters "-", "_", "+", "!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "'", "*", "/",  "=",
 * "?", "^", "`", "{", "|", "}", "~" are valid in the local part of email
 * address according to RFC, though most of these are highly improbable in any
 * reallife address. We may add a means of limiting this list in the future,
 * for now you may use the 'notregex' rule to disallow some of these if needed.
 *
 * As recommended in the RFC, the local part must
 * not be longer than 64 characters and the domain part 255. This means
 * that the address can be up to 320 characters long. The number of
 * subdomains is arbitrary limited to 10. You can use the maxlength rule in
 * conjunction if you need to enforce shorter addresses. A length of 100
 * for the whole address is usually far enough.
