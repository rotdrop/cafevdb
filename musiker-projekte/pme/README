Changes from last version
-------------------------
Used phpMyEdit.class.php Version 1.215 - the latest in cvs
Used phpMyEditSetup.php Version 1.51 - the latest in cvs
Multiselect was not working in the previous version. Works in this.
You will need to edit one line in phpMyEdit.class.php to suite your site.
Line # 289 :
                $base="http://www.yoursite.com/pme";

Previous version Notes
----------------------
Currene versions of phpMyEdit.class.php and the mce-cal extensions, the calendar does not work, and it's a pain to get tinymce working.
Here is a fully functional version of the base class which includes tinymce and jscal2. You don't need any extensions for this to work.
Everything is bundled here. Unzip, set up your db, set up test table (see screenshot.png for the structure), edit test.php and change 
db credentials and you should be ready to go. All of the jscal2 parameters should work.

phpMyEdit class version : 1.215
tinymce version: 3.4.5
jscal version : jscal2-1.9

phpMyEdit - http://www.phpmyedit.org/
tinymce - http://www.tinymce.com/
jscal - http://www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar/

By default shows a calendar image next to the date field. If you don't want this modify phpMyEdit.class.php, lines:
 if ($do_button) {
                $base=(basename(dirname(__FILE__)));
                echo '<button id="',$cal_ar['button'],'" style="background: url(',"'",$base,"/images/pme-calendar.png')",'">',$label,'</button>';
            } else {
                echo '<span style="cursor: pointer" id="',$cal_ar['button'],'">',$label,'</span>';
            }
to:
            if ($do_button) {
                echo '<button id="',$cal_ar['button'],'">',$label,'</button>';
            } else {
                echo '<span style="cursor: pointer" id="',$cal_ar['button'],'">',$label,'</span>';
            }
